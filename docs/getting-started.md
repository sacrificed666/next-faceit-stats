# 🏁 Getting started

## 📋 Requirements

| Tool              | Version                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Node.js        | **24 or newer**; `.nvmrc` pins `26`, the newest line |
| 📦 npm            | 11 or newer (ships with Node 24)                     |
| 🔑 FACEIT API key | A **server-side** key for the FACEIT Data API        |
| 🌐 Browser        | Any evergreen browser                                |

> [!TIP]
> With a version manager, run `nvm use` (or `fnm use`) in the project root to switch to the Node.js line from `.nvmrc`.

## 🗝️ Getting a FACEIT API key

1. 🧑‍💻 Sign in at [developers.faceit.com](https://developers.faceit.com) with your FACEIT account.
2. 📱 Create an app. Any name works, for example _Squad stats_.
3. 🗝️ Open the app's **API keys** tab and create a key of type **Server side**.
4. 📋 Copy the key into `FACEIT_API_KEY` in `.env` as it is: no quotes and no `Bearer` prefix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a **server-side** key. Client-side keys are bound to browser origins and FACEIT rejects them when the server calls the API.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never commit `.env` and never give the key a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. The key only lives on the server and is never sent to the browser, see [Security](./security.md#-the-api-key).

## 🔑 Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable            | Required | What it does                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔑 `FACEIT_API_KEY` | Required | Server-side FACEIT Data API key                                                                                                   |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 `FACEIT_PLAYERS` | Required | FACEIT nicknames separated by commas, spaces or new lines, up to 20                                                               |
| 🌍 `SITE_URL`       | Optional | Public address used in canonical links, Open Graph cards and the sitemap. On Vercel the production domain is used automatically   |
| 🛰️ `FACEIT_API_URL` | Optional | Base address of the FACEIT Data API, `https://open.faceit.com/data/v4/` by default. The end-to-end tests point it at a local mock |

> [!NOTE]
> FACEIT looks nicknames up **case-sensitively**: `JACKSONGG` and `jacksongg` are different players. Copy each nickname exactly as it appears on the FACEIT profile.

Without the two required variables the app still starts and shows which ones are missing. Restart the server after changing `.env`.

## 📦 Install and run

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. It redirects to your browser's language, for example `/en` or `/uk`. The first page load fetches the whole squad from FACEIT, which takes a few seconds; after that the data is cached for five minutes.

### 🐳 In Docker

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f docker/development.yaml up --watch
```

The same dev server runs in a container on port 3000 with the variables from `.env` (and `.env.local`, if present), and Compose Watch copies every change into it. Staging and production images are described in [Deployment](./deployment.md#-docker).

## 📜 npm scripts

| `npm test`              | 👁️ Starts Vitest in watch mode                                                            |
| `npm run test:run`      | 🧪 Runs the whole unit test suite once                                                    |
| `npm run test:coverage` | 📊 Runs the unit tests with V8 coverage and enforces the thresholds                       |

| `npm run check`         | ✅ Lint, format check, type check and unit tests in one go; run it before pushing         |

> [!TIP]
> Install the browser for the end-to-end tests once with `npx playwright install chromium`.

Every component has its own folder, for example `features/dashboard/ui/MapPool/MapPool.tsx`, and tests sit next to the code they cover as `*.test.ts(x)`. How the layers work together is explained in [Architecture](./architecture.md#️-layers).

## 💻 Editor setup

Editor settings are not committed. For the best experience in VS Code, install:

- 🦀 **Oxc**: inline Oxlint diagnostics and Oxfmt formatting on save
- ⚡ **Vitest**: run and debug tests from the editor
- 🎭 **Playwright Test for VS Code**: run end-to-end tests and record locators
- 📝 **EditorConfig**: consistent whitespace settings (`.editorconfig` is part of the repository)
- 🔷 Select **TypeScript: Use Workspace Version** so the editor uses the project's TypeScript and the Next.js plugin

## 👉 Next steps

- ✨ See what the dashboard can do in [Features](./features.md).
- 🏗️ Follow a request from FACEIT to the page in [Architecture](./architecture.md).
- 🚀 Put it online with [Deployment](./deployment.md).
