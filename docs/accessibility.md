# ♿ Accessibility

The goal is **WCAG 2.2 AA**: everything works with a keyboard, reads well with a screen reader and keeps its contrast in both themes.

## 🧭 Structure

| Element      | Implementation                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏠 Landmarks | `header`, `main`, `footer` and labelled `nav` elements for sections and breadcrumbs                                   |
| ⏭️ Skip link | **Skip to content** appears on the first <kbd>Tab</kbd> and moves focus to `main`                                     |
| 🏷️ Headings  | One `h1` per page, an `h2` per section, `h3` inside cards                                                             |
| 🗂️ Regions   | Every section is a `section` labelled by its heading                                                                  |
| 📋 Tables    | Real tables with captions, `scope` on headers and a row header for every player                                       |
| 🌍 Language  | `lang` on the document matches the page language; each language in the settings carries its own `lang` and `hreflang` |

## ⌨️ Keyboard

Every control is a native element, so it behaves the way browsers and assistive technology expect:

| Control                          | Element                                            | Keys                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎚️ Range, metrics, theme, result | Radio group inside a `fieldset` with a `legend`    | <kbd>Tab</kbd> to the group, arrows to choose     |
| ↕️ Sortable columns              | `button` inside `th` with `aria-sort`              | <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>              |
| 🗺️ Map filter                    | `select`                                           | Arrows                                            |
| 📋 Data tables                   | `details` and `summary`                            | <kbd>Enter</kbd>                                  |
| 📈 Charts                        | `input type="range"` over the plot                 | Arrows, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>           |
| 🃏 Player cards                  | One link that covers the card                      | <kbd>Enter</kbd>                                  |
| ⚙️ Settings                      | `button` that opens a native `<dialog popover>`    | <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close |
| ⚔️ Compared players              | Two labelled `select` elements and a swap `button` | Arrows, <kbd>Enter</kbd>                          |
| 🕹️ Recent matches                | **Show more matches** `button`                     | <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>              |

Focus is always visible: a 2 px accent outline with an offset, and a ring around the whole card when its link has focus.

## 🗣️ Screen readers

- 🏆 Sorted columns announce their direction through `aria-sort`, and the table caption says how the table is sorted.
- ✅ Win and loss badges are letters for sighted users (**W** and **L** in English, **В** and **П** in Ukrainian) and whole words for screen readers; the form guide reads as one sentence, newest first.
- 🥇 Medals say _1st place_, level badges say _Level 10_, and records such as `12-8` are read as _Wins: 12, losses: 8_.
- 🎚️ Level progress and playstyle bars are native `<meter>` elements with a spoken value, for example _63 ELO to level 9_.
- 📈 Each chart is a slider: moving it announces the date, map, result and every value of that match. A **Show data table** button below every chart offers the same numbers as a table, with real column and row headers, and turns into **Hide data table** while it is open.
- ⚔️ Every row of the comparison tells screen readers who is ahead, for example _Kills per death, anna is ahead_, because the highlight alone is visual.
- 🕹️ The feed reads K-D-A as _Kills: 20, deaths: 15, assists: 4_, and **Showing 16 of 40** is announced politely after **Show more matches**.
- 🌍 The language button says _Language: English (EN)_, so its name contains the visible code and voice control users can say what they see.
- 🔗 Links that open FACEIT or Steam say _opens in a new tab_, and every **Match room** link of the records names its map, so a list of links never repeats the same name.
- 🖼️ Avatars are decorative because the nickname is always next to them; flags carry the country name.
- ⏳ Loading screens announce _Loading…_ through an `output` element while the skeleton stays hidden from assistive technology.

## 🎨 Colour and contrast

- 📏 Text reaches **4.5:1** against its background in both themes, large numbers and graphical marks reach **3:1**.
- 🚦 Colour never carries meaning alone: wins and losses have letters, differences have arrows and signs, heatmap cells print their value, medals print their place.
- 🌡️ The heatmap's green and red are tuned to stay apart for red-green colour blindness, see [Design system](./design.md#-green-and-red-for-everyone), and its text stays readable on every cell.

## 🌊 Motion and preferences

| Preference                  | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🐢 `prefers-reduced-motion` | Transitions, the skeleton pulse, the fade-in of data and smooth scrolling are switched off                                                                                                                |
| 🌗 `prefers-color-scheme`   | Picks the theme unless the visitor chose one                                                                                                                                                              |
| 🔆 `prefers-contrast: more` | Secondary text and borders get stronger                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 🖥️ `forced-colors: active`  | Windows high contrast keeps every card border, the chosen option of each switch, data bars and legends visible with system colours; the current page link is underlined; heatmap cells keep their colours |

> [!NOTE]
> In forced colours mode browsers replace author colours with the visitor's system palette, which would erase anything drawn only with a background colour. Bars, legend swatches and chosen options therefore carry the `mark` and `choice` classes, which switch them to system colours such as `Highlight` instead.

## 📱 Zoom and small screens

The layout reflows down to **320 px**, the width of a 1280 px window zoomed to 400 %, without horizontal page scrolling (WCAG 1.4.10). Wide tables scroll inside their card with the player column pinned, the range toolbar wraps onto a second row, and text can be zoomed to 200 % without losing content.

## ✅ How it is checked

- 🤖 **axe-core** runs in the end-to-end tests on the overview, a player page, the comparison and the 404 page in English, Ukrainian, Polish and Dutch, in light and dark mode, on desktop and phone screens, with no violations. The experimental `label-content-name-mismatch` rule is switched on too.
- 🖥️ A forced colours test checks that the chosen range and the ranking bars stay visible with system colours.
- 📱 Five pages in four languages are checked for sideways scrolling at 320 px.
- 🚦 **Lighthouse** must score 1 for accessibility on every page of the budget, and every accessibility audit must pass, including the ones without weight.
- 🧪 Component tests find elements by role and accessible name, so a missing label fails a test.
- ⌨️ The pull request checklist asks for a pass with the keyboard only, in both themes and on a phone-sized screen.

> [!TIP]
> To check a change by hand, use the keyboard only, then open Chrome DevTools, choose **Rendering** and emulate `forced-colors: active`, `prefers-contrast: more` and a vision deficiency such as deuteranopia.
